TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION WITH OBJECT DETECTION

Author: Hari Krishnan

1. Introduction:
 
This project presents an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence pipeline that combines Natural Language
Processing, Image Generation, and Computer Vision.
 The system generates text from a user prompt, converts it into an image, and detects objects present in the generated image.

2.  Aim:

To develop an AI-based system that generates images from text prompts and performs object
detection on the generated images. 
3. Technologies Used:
 
Python, PyTorch, Transformers (GPT-2), Diffusers (Stable Diffusion), YOLOv8, Pillow, and
OpenCV.

4. Project Workflow:
 
Step 1: Text generation using GPT-2.
Step 2: Image generation using Stable Diffusion.
Step 3: Object detection using YOLOv8.

5. How to Run the Project:

Install the required dependencies and execute the Python script text_to_image.py.
Enter a text prompt when prompted by the system.

6. Applications:

AI content creation, academic mini-projects, computer vision learning, and creative image
generation.

8. Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effective integration of multiple AI domains into a single system,
showcasing the practical use of modern AI tools.
